1) System-wide installation:

    1.1  Become root and explode tpipe-1.6.tar.gz:

	# tar xfz -C /usr/local/src tpipe-1.6.tar.gz

    1.2  Move to the tpipe source:

	# cd /usr/local/src/tpipe-1.6

    1.3  Review the Makefile before proceeding as usual:

	# make install

    If you have no make utility, compile and install by hand:

		# cc -o tpipe tpipe.c

		# cp tpipe /usr/local/bin
		# cp tpipe.1 /usr/local/man/man1

    ...and you are done.


Good practice:

    /usr/local/bin should always be in the PATH of every user.

    Leave the source at /usr/local/src so you can make uninstall in the future.



2) Installing for just yourself without root permission:

    Compile and install as previously explained, substituting /usr/local
    for your $HOME directory.


Good practice:

    Have a $HOME/src directory as well as a $HOME/bin in your $PATH
    and a $HOME/man/man1 in your $MANPATH or /etc/manpath.config
    so you can:

	$ cp tpipe $HOME/bin
	$ cp tpipe.1 $HOME/man/man1
